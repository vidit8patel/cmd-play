# Flappy Bird React (Vite)

A React + Vite port of the Flappy Bird game. 

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The game will be available at http://localhost:8080

## Notes
- This is a React port. The core game logic should be ported from the original game.js.
- Customize `src/FlappyBirdGame.tsx` to add gameplay, graphics, and questions logic.
